Dokumentaro is a theme for generating static websites with [wmk]. You can write source files for your web pages using Markdown and HTML.[^1] Wmk builds your site by converting all content files to HTML that will be wrapped in layout templates. There are many [settings][wmk configuration] that affect the operation of the theme. They are  set in the `wmk_config.yaml` file or added in the form of custom templates.

/// note
Dokumentaro uses Dart Sass for its stylesheets, which requires a recent version of wmk â€“ at least version 1.19, released in January 2025. The `sass` binary must also be installed and be in your `PATH`, if you wish to build a site which uses the Dokumentaro theme.
///


This documentation for the Dokumentaro theme is an example of how it can be used. It shows its default appearance. However, you can easily [customize] the appearance as well as the functionality.

## Getting started

See the [general instructions][theme-instructions] on how to use a theme in wmk.

## About the project
