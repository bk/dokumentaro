# Auxiliary Links

You can add a list of auxiliary links to your site, shown at the top right on all pages. You do this by including the `aux_links` [configuration option](../../configuration/#aux-links) in your site's `wmk_config.yaml` file.

## Example Auxiliary Link {: .text-delta }

```yaml
site:
  aux_links:
    - title: wmk on GitHub
      url: https://github.com/bk/wmk
```
